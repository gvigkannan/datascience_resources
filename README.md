## A collection of resources to facilitate your journey into data science

Before getting started with data science it's important to realize there are many different roles involved:

![alt text](https://github.com/justinmccoy/datascience_resources/blob/master/media/roles.png "Roles")


* **Data Engineer** ingesting, exploring, transforming, cleaning and understand data
* **Data Scientist** shaping and evaluating data, creating or building models, and communicating and sharing results
* **Business Analyst** understand the problem domain, evaluating models, or communicating results
* **App Developer** consumes data and models to create applications

Data science is considered a _[team sport](http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/06/theres-more-than-one-kind-of-data-scientist.html)_ due to these different roles and need for collaboration. Instead of working in siloed environments it's helpful to have a central platform for all the roles to collaborate, for this I recommend getting started with the [Data Science Experience](https://datascience.ibm.com/). Here you can import data from many different sources, clean and transform the data, use tools and libraries of your choice (RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, SPSS, TensorFlow), train and test models, setup automation of tasks, easily communicate results (Pixie Dust) and share models for consumption as API endpoints.  You get all of this built on top of Apache Spark and IBMâ€™s Cloud Platform.
